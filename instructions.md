# Instructions

1) First, I made the repo __lab01b-github-markdown__ on github.
2) I removed the practice file `new-file.txt` with `rm` and pushed the changes to github using these commands
    * `git add -A`
    * `git commit -m ''`
    * `git push`
3) Next, I created the directories `src/assets` with `mkdir -p src/assets` in my `alchemy` directory.
4) Then I made the files `instructions.md` and `grettings.md` with `touch instructions.md` and `echo 'Hello There! > greetings.md`, respectively.
5) Then we `cd assets` and use the command `touch style.css app.js` to create the `style.css` and `app.js` files.
6) Last, I _still need to_ push all of these changes to git! For this I repeat the commands from step 2.
